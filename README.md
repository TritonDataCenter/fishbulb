# Fishbulb: browser library and widgets for Cloud Analytics

Fishbulb provides a browser library for Cloud Analytics, including a a client
library for managing data as well as some useful widgets.  Fishbulb also
provides a demo portal for using CA.

# Running the demo portal

To run the demo portal, you currently must have direct access to the CA backend
service (not the public-facing API).  After cloning this repo, simply open up
www/index.html in your browser, enter the IP of the CA backend service, and
click "Connect".


# Status

This library is a work in progress.  The demo is moderately functional, but the
widget library interface is highly unstable.
