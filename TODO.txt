- Generalize legend code to address issue where clicking a heat map bucket
  gives a legend which is not sorted and whose values cannot be seen if there
  are too many.  This should use the same heuristic as the line graph legend
  code, handling too many values (adding "..." and sum, with "sum" labeled
  either "range average" or total as the case may be) and also handling
  selection.
- Legends
  - figure out why clicks sometimes get lost
  - right-click option to add predicate + decomposition
  - right-click option to add pivot
- Make y-axis labels be more specific (e.g., 1s instead of 1000000000)
- Implement advanced create-time options
  - Save data persistently
  - Tweak granularity, ndatapoints, timeout interval
  - Add decompositions and predicates with initial metric
  - Add customer-scoped view
  - Add public API backend
- Other advanced options:
  - change heat map bucket size
  - option to show median, Nth percentile
- Handle errors better, including:
  - CA not available at startup
  - Transient failure of the CA service
  - Heat map: impose maximum width based on backend's maximum
