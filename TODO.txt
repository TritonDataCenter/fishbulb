- Legends
  - right-click option to add pivot
- Make y-axis and legend labels be more appropriate
  (e.g., 1s instead of 1000000000)
- Implement advanced create-time options
  - Save data persistently
  - Tweak granularity, ndatapoints, idle timeout
  - Add predicates with initial metric
  - May want to hide most of this in a dialog ("advanced create")
- Advanced init-time options:
  - Add customer-scoped view
  - Add public API backend
  - Add ability to save a session and restore it using a link (or cookie):
    - "save" serializes the current state via JSON and either saves it to a
      cookie or gives you a link that you can give to anyone else
    - "restore" deserializes the JSON blob and loads the given widgets, dealing
      with errors due to auth, or expired instrumentations
- Other advanced options:
  - change heat map bucket size
  - option to show median, Nth percentile
- Handle errors better, including:
  - Report create-time validation errors better
  - CA not available at startup
  - Transient failure of the CA service
  - Heat map: impose maximum width based on backend's maximum
